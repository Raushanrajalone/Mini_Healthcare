This is a simple frontend-only healthcare support web application created as a concept-level prototype.  
The app is designed to help healthcare organizations or NGOs collect patient queries and provide basic guidance instantly.

## AI / Automation Concept
This project uses a rule-based automation approach:
- After form submission, users receive an automatic response message.
- A simple FAQ chatbot provides instant answers to common health-related questions such as fever, cold, and emergency situations.

No real AI API or backend is used. The focus is on demonstrating the concept.

## Healthcare / NGO Use Case
- Collect basic patient information
- Provide instant guidance for common health issues
- Reduce response time for NGOs and healthcare support teams
- Useful as a first-level support system before human follow-up

## Note
